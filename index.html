                    <p>First morning. Unceremoniously awoken by K’s Italians, who, it turns out, were flying out this
                        morning. Noise was heroically loud, was like a bad impression of somebody trying to be quiet but
                        failing absolutely for comic effect. It is now 07:30, will be leaving soon. K’s place is 2
                        floors up opposite the Regina Sophia. Pokey. Slept on a sofa about 2ft too small and so feeling
                        a little shrunken and worse for wear. Arrived yesterday at lunchtime after an early flight. Have
                        eaten only potatoes, eggs and bread for the last 24 hours. </p>

                    <p>Yesterday saw a little of the city, sat in parks and bars, spoke to K’s friends of cycling, of
                        Europe and art. We are a full contingent now Josh having arrived last night and D coming over
                        with me. The city is big and small. Hiding from itself. On hills and without respite. The
                        architecture seems homogenous except startling modernist drops. Like Regina Sophia and some
                        other cultural buildings. Me and D visited this gallery for a few hours last night, its free
                        from 7-9. Saw Miro, Picasso, Dali, Gonzales, other Spanish modernists. Also saw the beginning of
                        a exhibition on playgrounds.</p>

                    <p>Awoken on day 2 (morning 2) in Granada. Staying in Albaicín a mini-Marrakesh in the north of the
                        city in the shadow of the Alhambra. Josh and D have just returned with pastries and K is in the

                    <p>Yesterday was overburdened. Was a huge and ripe day. Began early and after some car/sat nav
                        issues we got to the airport for insurance and then to our first stop in Toledo. Parking by the
                        bull ring we walking up into the old city climbing and trying to get lost in its passages and
                        alleyways. The cathedral here was stunning crammed in but splendid. The Jewish quarter was a
                        relief from the gawd of much of the lower slopes and from here we could take in the whole city.
                        Brought some soft fruit and a sandwich and drove on.</p>

                    <p>Slept and read for the next few hours before arriving in Jean. This town was an unexpected
                        delight. Again, the old town and the cathedral dominated the visit. We climbed to the highest
                        point in the town to take in the vista. Jean was sleepy but welcoming. We made up a possible
                        future life in Jean, of writing and falling in love. Had some bar tapas and from here back on
                        the road.</p>

                    <p>The final stop and resting point was Granada. Parking on the hill and walking into town before
                        scoffing a falafel and heading back up to the palace for our 10:00pm spot, was all we had time
                        for, considering everything else we’d packed into the day. The palace was stunning,
                        indescribable. The non-figurative art was more transcendent more meditative and holy that any of
                        the catholic iconography we’d seen throughout the day. The day finished in a fusion palace with
                        a beer and a salad of apple, nuts, olives before sleep. </p>

                    <p>Just the two cities yesterday. Breakfasted on the terrace overlocking much of the town and in
                        turn being overlooked by the Alhambra. It was towards the that we then set off in the shaded
                        hear up the hills of the Albaicín. This was a wonderful walk. A new wonder around every corner.
                        Constant changes of perspective and colours of buildings eventually emerging at the river to
                        then climb up to the Generalife gardens and palace. Had nice conversations with K about London
                        and Sheffield while walking among cypress trees and fountains. A final walk into town to glimpse
                        the cathedral and Capilla Real, both of which somewhat paled in relation to their Islamic
                        brother son the hill. Granada is hugely appealing and will certainly draw me back. The goodbye
                        took place as we walked back up the hill to the car, slowly slipping out of the town just as we
                        had arrived.</p>

                    <p>The drive to Saville was fairly un eventful. Caught up with Laurie’s opinions and epitaphs. We
                        arrived and parked with some difficulty but close the apartments on the edge of Triana. The is
                        the area LL describes so vividly so it was a boon to discover we are staying here. The apartment
                        is long, thin, with one central room 3 floors up overlooking a road. Our first night was
                        somewhat inadvertently spent getting quite drunk first on the flat then in bars close and the
                        further into the city. Had a not quite stand-up argument about working hours. It was heated but
                        in love or rather with love. The night ended with expensive brandy and a slow walk home to
                        sleep, after talking until 4:00.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="entry content">
                    <p>The first morning. Awake with a mild hangover, unsurprisingly as spent much money and drank much
                        booze last night. Are staying in a nice apartment in the north of Bordeaux, a light industrial
                        area about 45 mins walk to the centre. This afternoon we are off to Spain en train.
                    </p>
                    <p>Last night was fun, if eventful for the wrong reasons. We arrived in the city around 5 or 6
                        having been slightly delayed but consoled by beers at Luton airport. After a long bus journey
                        and a brief meeting with our proprietress we visited the aparto before walking back into town
                        along the river. This was a lovely walk punctuated by a few stops for wine and food. The river
                        bent towards us and widened, very wide at its widest. The prom was well used and intermittently
                        zoned with shops, and bars. All sympathetically done. Dinner was galette and a salad outside a
                        bar with a cave like interior just next to the Hotel de Ville. From here we went searching for
                        more wine settling on cocktails and some new English pals who we later played pool with and then
                        grew tired of.
                    </p>
                    <p>K had a blighted evening. At the restaurant his card got destroyed by the card reader. Somehow.
                        Later, far more painfully his phone was stolen almost certainly by a guy who was in the last
                        bar. We think he must have handed it off to a mate and then had deniability. All quite horrible
                        and bizarre. A sour note to finish the night on. The walk home was intermittently biter and
                        released. We are now all buttered up and about to leave for a few hours here before the trip
                        south.

                    <p>The second morning now, in the second aparto, second city. Enjoy toast, jam, apples and coffee
                        looking out over the bay of San Sebastian. Yesterday was mainly spent travelling. We left our
                        northern flat and took trams south to Gare Saint John to sus trains and tickets to Spain. Ended
                        up with about 4 hours in hand which we used to wander around saint Michel, through a closing
                        market, some arcades and finally to eat some Italian good before rushing an uber to the station.
                        Enjoyed the Bordeaux visit though it feels a lot like a city for the rich. Perhaps this is just
                        a facet of its architecture and the particular spots we visited. </p>
                    <p>The journey south was lovely, through pine woods to the coast at Biarritz – on a double decker
                        French train. Spoke of the Cruel Optimism project, London pubs, Midnight clubs of the past and
                        the future. Bands to be formed. Read of Urras, slept a little before arriving at Hendaye and
                        bolted onto the second commuter train – which wound its way along the coast armed with z’s and
                        x’s into Donistia. </p>
                    <p>The arrival was met with a cool breeze and a blue sky. We walked through the late C19th streets
                        to the sea. This town. It’s so beautiful.</p>

                    <p> Walking along the prom we soon arrived at our apartment overlooking the harbour with incredible views across the bay. After leaving our bags
                        we walked away from the bay round the head talking of the sublime and sympathetic modernist
                        architecture. Walking back to the old town after stopping for a few beers, we ate in a loud
                        bright cafeteria style bar with hidden bacon under every courgette. We finished the night on the
                        terrace outside a bar with a bottle of red wine looking across the bay at the sea before
                        retiring for sleep and a full Donistian day. </p>

                        extra bag. Planning to walk round the bay and up the hill we did just that. Barefoot and
                        overlayered we funicualted up to the top of a hill described by an acquaintance of K’s as “black
                        mirror cool” but really simply an old fun fair with an even older observation tower. Ascending
                        the slowly taking in a n old photography exhibition and accompanied by a soundtrack of 90s pop
                        coming from precariously hung speakers. Reaching the roof and incredible vistas we sat, drank
                        the rest of last nights wine and marvelled for the best part of an hour. Upon descending we saw
                        kittens and spoke of sexism before walking back round the quay and briefly home to change then
                        out again to swim and picnic on the beach.</p>

                    <p>On the flight now to Porto. Not yet taken off. We are to walk the Portuguese Camino. Porto to
                        Santiago. 10 days walking. Approx 14/15 miles per day. But a long first day. We met after work
                        at Liverpool Street had some Leon and expressed to Stansted. Got a few last minuet things and
                        had a pint before boarding. I would say we a reasonably unprepared but perhaps not the least
                        prepared of anyone who has walked the Camino. I’ll check back in tomorrow evening.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="entry content">
                    <p>2nd night. At the albergue in Velo de Campo. We have our own room which is ideal. 5 bunks we are
                        all on the bottom. Flight was fine. Fairly uneventful. Read a little, the intro to Pessoa’s
                        poetry. Arriving we light railed, with a hefty wait to the hotel before exploring a little of
                        the city. Walking downhill towards the sea we stopped at a café, ate some chips and salad and
                        beer. Later we walked roads high above he river, looping back to the hotel where we were abed
                        v.v. late – approx. 2:30/3am.</p>
                    <p>Woke at 8, showered, packed and walked down to the cathedral for about 09:15. Have been struck by
                        the variety of facades and ingenuity of typography on the streets of Porto. Having collected
                        stamps we headed out following steps downhill with yellow arrows. After some confusion about the
                        way, we realised that our routes aligned with the central for the first 6.6km.</p>
                    <p>The route wound through the city. Along back streets, past blue and white tiled Romanesque
                        churches. We stopped at 11 for some coffee and pastel de nata. The urban abated after walking
                        under a major ring road. Soon we were on the edge of corn fields and on cobbled streets through
                        villages on the outskirts of the city. </p>
                    <p>Some bright purple bind weed and other flowers of purple were floral highlights. Spotted many
                        Cabbage whites along with actual cabbages and something like a meadow brown but with a bright
                        blue body. A highlight, lepidopterily, was a perhaps recently pupated beautiful butterfly. It
                        had a strange body shape and was cream and brown stripped with bits of blue on the lower wing.
                        We shepherded it on a belle rue though a village about half way though the day.</p>
                    <p>Sections of agricultural walking we interrupted with settlements. We stopped for a substantial
                        lunch in a town on the route. Beyond here was the airport, other towns and villages, shopping
                        outlets and roads through forests of eucalyptus and pine.</p>
                    <p>We never walked off the road, which to me felt unusual for a long distance footpath. But there
                        were lots of periods that did feel away from built up areas . We spoke of work, of memories of
                        walking, of love a little. Ultimately it was a long day. 28km plus more before and after. On
                        arriving here we settled in to the albergue, showered changed and headed out for some beers and
                        food. Drank in a nice bar made a plan to try and watch the rugby tomorrow. We ate down by the
                        river, pasta, aubergine and port. A red green wine. Got back to the albergue just before lights
                        out. To wake at 8 and onwards.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="entry content">
                    <p>Slept ok. Awoke at 2 as was too hot, annoyingly too cold later. Were out of the albergue by about
                        8:45. Managed to find a bar that we persuaded to put the rugby on. Was perfect. Coffee, ice tea
                        and pasties from next door. Setting off proper at about 11, quite late, we walking Vilo do
                        Campo, a quite lovely small city. Passed various squared, a cinema museum. We followed suburban
                        streets out of the town eventually reaching the sea in Vazim.</p>
                    <p>Another beautiful blue hot day, we bought lunch at a supermarket and sat and paddled on the
                        beach. Enormous waves. Before walking (finally!) along the coast. The town stretched out fairly
                        far to north, large ocean views, apartment blocks and sea side restaurants. After a mile or so
                        we reached the start of miles of board walks over sand dunes and again finally away from roads.
                    </p>
                    <p>We lunched well on crisps and hums and slept a while. The landscape here changed to more
                        agricultural and we were soon again on roads tracking through forests of bamboo and eucalyptus.
                    </p>
                    <p>We past many, like 4 or 5,? Football grounds. An unexpected highlight. As well as wild fennel and
                        painted ladies. After some miles we reached Fao a lovely town on the banks of the Duomo river.
                        Walking through back streets we came to the river before crossing and pressing on to Esposende.
                    </p>
                    <p>Decided here to stay in a hostel in town rather than an albergue after we spent a little more
                        than expected but have a nice private room with ensuite. After walking around town a little we
                        had pizza and have now returned. The boys are quite battered. Kiers foot is causing him a lot of
                        grief and Davs muscles but overall I think we are going to be OK. Now to bed. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="entry content">
                    <p>Day 3 of the walk, 4 in total. A nice day. Out of Esposende along the road to the coast, briefly,
                        in land through a forest and then traditional cobbled streets for 3 or 4 miles through villages.
                        A climb with a few stages of forest walking were enjoyable and much closer to the kind of
                        walking I am used to. We huddled on the edge of a wood and pressed on from here down through a
                        few villages across Ponte Eiffel into Viana do Castelo.</p>

                    <p>Its now about 10pm and we are in the albergue, in a school(?) through the back of a church. 7
                        beds mostly full so we will experience our first night in shared accommodation. I enjoyed the
                        day but the boys are now a little walking wounded and we are debating walking less on future
                        days. We shall see… Tonight we ate well with wine/beer/port and saw in sunset atop a mountain on
                        the edge of town. Lights still on in the albergue but hopefully will sleep soon.</p>
